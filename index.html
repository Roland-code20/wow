        <h2>Mental Health Matters — More Than You Know</h2>  
        <p>
          Mental health is the foundation of how we think, feel, connect with others, and navigate life. It influences our ability to handle stress, make decisions, maintain relationships, and find purpose in our daily lives. Yet, for something so vital, it's often misunderstood, overlooked, or even stigmatized.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the World Health Organization, over <strong>970 million people globally</strong> — that’s about <strong>1 in 8</strong> — live with a mental disorder such as anxiety, depression, or PTSD. Every year, <strong>700,000 people die by suicide</strong>, making it one of the leading causes of death among young adults aged 15 to 29. Still, in many parts of the world, <strong>up to 85% of those affected receive no treatment at all</strong>.

        <h2>Everyone Faces Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Mental health struggles aren't always visible. They can be as quiet as struggling to get out of bed, feeling disconnected even in a crowd, or losing interest in things you once loved. Anyone — students, parents, professionals — can experience these struggles due to stress, trauma, loss, or even social media pressures.
        </p>
        <p>
          People cope in different ways. Some turn inward, others mask their pain. Some journal or meditate. Many just wish they had someone to talk to.
